# An Applied History of Generic Programming

This presentation reviews some of the different kinds of generic programming
(as in parameterized types) that emerged in various languages. The trade-offs
that are made by some of these languages is compared and a look at emerging
languages and standards gives us an idea of where things are going next.

To view the slide-deck, you'll need an X11 environment as well as headers for
building the C project (TODO: list these). Building and running the slides is
the accomplished by running `make`.

Keybindings and font adjustment are available for configuration or review in
`sent/config.def.h`. Make your adjustments to `sent/config.h` if you're
adjusting the local build rather than committing permanent configuration
changes. To exit, press escape or q.
